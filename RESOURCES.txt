## Export
Export data from drupal to JSON using views datasource.

### What to export
===Views to export===


As much as we can export (until related data breaks it)
Content Feeds
- Events (300 recent events.)
- Plays 
- Organizations
- Artists

Content Feeds filtered:
- Today


Export all fields for each of these content types so we can load data into the interface
Include everything we need to rebuild the interface (label, hover, popup, panel)
- Play (includes social media, permalink, title, content, related aggregated feed markup, edit link, related plays, etc (everything))
- Event
- Organization
- Artist

- All (??)



* Don't know yet - - What is the eventual data structure?

### Clean Up Data
Use google refine to template the data to geojson 
-- load csv or json or whatever is easier, export as many fields as possible, 
-- save CSV of all data to reinterpret into various formats while we figure out what is best (google refine can reload the data from the CSV easily)
-- geojson template
