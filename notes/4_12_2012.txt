loading information that is not in the map -- ex. a play organization that is not loaded
hover try to find in the jsonObject - if not search database - and insert it -- into a temporary information layer that we can unlaod if it gets too big

-- on mouse interaction of a differnet/new play
-- look up path in ALL of the jsonData based on the type
-- if it exists based on that type, load it, if NOT then go look in special bigger database( search) - if found, go load that record and append it to the jsonData in a special information layer such as

jsonData.play (play journey, object of related events)
if more than 50 items are loaded, garbage collection - bump old ones off the end
jsonData.organization
jsonData.event
jsonData.artist

the data stays, so after searching primary data sources, search secondary ones, if not then load them into the secondary one


___ these currently exist:
these are basically a pre-search -- for convenience/presentation are loaded
