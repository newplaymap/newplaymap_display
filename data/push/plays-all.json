She gathered around her an incredible circle of emancipated nineteenth-century women: painters, poets, sculptors and literary women, many of whom she financially supported. She had intense love affairs with several of them.\r\n\r\nFondakowski&#039;s project is based on the collection in the Library of Congress of over 1,000 unpublished letters, written by Cushman to Emma Crow, the transcription of which has been a ten-year labor of love by scholar Lisa Merrill.

The story follows two outlaws who become unlikely friends after breaking out of jail together. Froggy is a shiftless drifter without a destination. He joins Injun Bill Picote who is singularly focused on finding the man who turned his dead partner\u2019s skin into a pair of shoes. Their adventures force them to the edge of survival. This leads them to become loyal partners in their travels. Although it is a comedy with lovable characters and smart dialogue, it explores the question of friendship, loyalty and connection in a dangerous place and time. It also explores the concept of vengeance, its worth and consequences. This certainly will resonate with audiences who deal with the ever-shifting frontiers of the 21st Century on a daily basis.","Path":"\/play\/dead-mans-shoes"}},{"node":{"Play title":"Dead Pile","Play

Maine is distinctive among US states for having a vibrant organic farming community (including the oldest organic farming association, MOFGA, in the US); an abundance of family-owned farms, many going back generations; a nationally recognized local food cuisine which the New York Times says makes Portland \u201ca destination for rigorously local and regularly delicious food.\u201d  We appear to be reversing a decades long decline, in Maine and nationally, in the number of farms, farm acreage, and farming communities.

So what happens when you cram hundreds of thousands of independent minded people into a city where temperatures rise above 100 degrees more than seventy five days out of the year? You get enough hilarious drama to write an entire serial about.\r\n\r\nSeason one of Radio City Austin features the adventures of a variety of fictional Austin characters as their paths cross. Some of them have something to prove, some of them are hoping to find love, and some are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to feature a variety of Austin performers and playwrights in a way that celebrates Austin\u2019s creative culture while also providing Austin talent with a platform that has the potential to reach listeners around the world.

IVES. Set in a high-end hotel room at The Hague, WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA imagines former President George W. Bush on the eve of his trial for international war crimes. Tended to by an inscrutable Dutch butler and an alluring masseuse, the President embarks on a long night of drinking, joking, and ruminating, taking the audience through a deep exploration of how we regard our leaders - loving them, fearing them, unintentionally deifying them. WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA examines an American populace that has grown strikingly complacent in the wake of extraordinary global challenges, exposing one of the world\u2019s most intriguing and influential conflicts: the battle between the elected leader of the free world and a democracy of millions.
