Set in the years 1513-16 in and around Florence, we follow the life of Machiavelli, a one-time political insider now thrown out of the city. Exiled from everything but his beloved library of Greek and Roman texts, he endeavors to find his way back in to favor through the writing of a handbook for the Prince, but is unable to get any serious attention. Unexpectedly, Machiavelli's way off the blacklist turns out to be via the stage and the writing of a comedy. Throughout, it is his complex relationship to the women in his life -- wife, daughter, mistress, goddess -- that determines his true failure or success. The play features elements of Machiavelli's writings from the THE PRINCE and THE MANDRAGOLA, as well as from works\n by Savonorola, Pico della Mirandola, Lucretius, Plautus, Hippocrates, Galen, and others -- and music from, among others, Verdelot and Kay Starr.\nSaturday, February 11, 2012 - 8:00 PM\nSunday, February 12, 2012 - 2:30 PM\nThursday, February 16, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSaturday, February 18, 2012 - 2:30 PM\nWednesday, February 22, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSaturday, February 25, 2012 - 8:00 PM\nFriday, March 02, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSunday, March 04, 2012 - 2:30 PM","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/fortune-is-a-woman\/first-production-2012-02-11"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"26478","Date":"February 10, 2012","To Date":"February 18, 2012","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Production","Latitude":"61.217061","Longitude":"-149.894342","Play title":"The Blue Bear","Related Play ID":"26454","Generative Artist":"Luan Schooler &amp; Leon Ingulsrud","Artist ID":"26453","Related Theater":"Perseverance Theatre, Inc","Related Theater ID":"26449","Event description":"Second production and kick off of Perseverance Theatre's Anchorage season.","Synopsis":"In 1990, author Lynn Schooler was a guide in Juneau when he met the Japanese wildlife photographer, Michio Hoshino.

But when George and Ruby are suddenly surprised by the arrival of their daughter Nia from college with her new fianc\u00e9e Joseph, a young poet and budding novelist who is failing to channel his own machismo (physically, aesthetically, and in his sensibilities) in Nia\u2019s undying opinion , the Evans household becomes a powder-keg in which conflicting ideals of masculinity ignite an explosion of conflict between its four inhabitants.\n\"Kind of Blue\" is a part of Stewart's \"Companion Play Cycle\", eight distinct groups of plays, with five plays in each group, written as companion pieces to eight distinct forms of jazz including Dixieland, Swing, Bebop, Cool, Hard Bop, Modal, Free and Fusion. For each group of plays, Stewart takes any combination of aesthetic, technicality, and context in which a particular jazz style was created and uses that combination to create a dramatic structure or dramatic narrative for a play. The Companion Play Cycle was inspired by August Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle which paid homage to a contextualized experience, the categorically threaded of plays of William Shakespeare via the First Folio, and the desire to explore the most provocative existential questions through dramatic societal critique akin to Edward Albee. \n\"Kind of Blue\" is the first of the five Modal Plays in the Companion Play Cycle written as a companion piece to the style of Modal Jazz. The dramatic structure of \"Kind of Blue\" is born out of the technicality of Modal Jazz which employed the use of scales which were colloquially called \"modes\". While also being the namesake of the Modal Jazz album by Miles Davis, \"Kind of Blue\" explores different \"modes\" of masculinity and examines how varying understandings of male roles in society affects interpersonal relationship through a gritty and naturalistic drama. \nALL BY INVITATION ONLY!\nTo request an invitation, email RTC@RitualTheatreCompany.org","Synopsis":"In early 1940s New York City, George Evans (a middle-aged bartender) is beginning to struggle mightily with the patriarchal role he has been seeking his entire life.

This summer is its third residency at Ko.\nThe idea of an ensemble came about during a development residency in 2009 when the lead artists asked a handful of college-aged interns at the Ko Festival of Performance in Amherst to read some letters in translation, and then proposed exercises for them to play with on stage. They not only enjoyed reading the letters, but also helped Katie and Ellen answer questions about the play that they had begun to explore as a two-person piece. Enlivened by our commerce with them, they began to incorporate the ensemble into the work. The idea -- initially an accidental encounter -- has become a cornerstone of both the play\u2019s development and its structure. At its center, the play now has a group of young actors that is at times a chorus and at times a modern ensemble. They create the world in which we present the letters, individually play the letter writer at moments, and narrate their own exploration of the character and the century.","Synopsis":"INDUSTRIOUS ANGELS is a solo hand-crafted-story-spinning-shadow-puppet-memory-play-with-music evoking the secret creative lives of women, mother\/daughter bloodlines, and the ghost of Emily Dickinson.In a shadowed attic, crammed with curio cabinets, work tables, chests and drawers (containers for mementos and unmentionables), a daughter searches for what it is that ties together her mother, herself, and an elusive poet.

Rushing home to console his parents, he suspects a strange conspiracy between them to keep Ed from the truth.  Jimmy's girlfriend, Kassie, and Jim's best friend Lonnie, lead Ed on a journey into the darker parts of Jimmy's life, eventually leading to what his friends suspect was his accidental death from autoerotic asphyxiation.\nConfronting his parents with his suspicions, Ed forces them to recount the discovery of Jimmy's body.  Too embarrassed to admit the truth to anyone other than Ed, his parents steadfastly hold to the story that Jimmy killed himself, more willing to assume the role of parents of a suicidal teenager, than to face the disgrace of telling the public that their son accidentally died while masturbating.  Ed struggles with his relationship with God, his love for his parents and his dead brother, and most of all, the truth, as he tries to minister to his family and somehow find the common ground between truth and compassion.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/easier-than-the-truth\/first-production-2011-06-23"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"33892","Date":"June 23, 2011","To Date":"June 23, 2011","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Reading","Latitude":"40.760224","Longitude":"-73.992908","Play title":"Mean","Related Play ID":"33891","Generative Artist":"WilliamJack Sibley","Artist ID":"33890","Related Theater":"New Dramatists","Related Theater ID":"24770","Event description":"Mean (Public Alumni Reading)\nThursday, June 23, 2011\nPlaywright: William Jack Sibley\nDirector: Scott Rubsam\nActors: Ellen Burstyn, Rachel Dratch, Chris Stack\nStage Manager: Johnny Oleksinski\nAttendance: 52","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/mean\/reading-2011-06-23"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"11128","Date":"June 22, 2011","To Date":"June 22, 2011","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"First Production","Latitude":"41.314386","Longitude":"-72.924119","Play title":"Stories of a New America","Related Play ID":"11126","Generative Artist":"Collective Consciousness Theatre","Artist ID":"11125","Related Theater":"Collective Consciousness Theatre","Related Theater ID":"11124","Event description":"Stories of a New America features CCT company members and New Haven\u2019s refugees\u2014persecuted people from around the world\u2014telling true stories of refugee resettlement in New Haven.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/stories-of-a-new-america\/first-production-2011-06-22"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"30178","Date":"June 21, 2011","To Date":"June 24, 2011","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Presented Performance","Latitude":"38.907627","Longitude":"-77.071612","Play title":"Journey to the Door of No Return...","Related Play ID":"30177","Generative Artist":"Psalmayene 24","Artist ID":"11230","Related Theater":"Arena Stage","Related Theater ID":"8220","Event description":"Psalmayene 24\u2019s new play Journey to the Door of No Return\u2026 an exciting piece of Arena Stage\u2019s Downstairs New Play Series.

Locked in the battle that has defined their families' legacies, these quintessentially American daughters must fight to find a balance between justice and forgiveness.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/in-a-daughters-eyes\/first-production-2011-05-27"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"26477","Date":"May 25, 2011","To Date":"May 25, 2011","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Reading","Latitude":"40.758343","Longitude":"-73.990152","Play title":"The Blue Bear","Related Play ID":"26454","Generative Artist":"Luan Schooler &amp; Leon Ingulsrud","Artist ID":"26453","Related Theater":"Perseverance Theatre, Inc","Related Theater ID":"26449","Event description":"A reading of the script for an invited audience.","Synopsis":"In 1990, author Lynn Schooler was a guide in Juneau when he met the Japanese wildlife photographer, Michio Hoshino.

It continues to serve as a playwright-focused community event, bringing artists and community together to promote the spirit of radical inclusion and invite artists to dialogue about an emerging form of theatre.  Past New York festivals have included: The Brick Theater in Williamsburg (also partnering with Monarch Theatre 2007); TBG Arts Theatre (2008); HERE Arts Center as part of the Autumn Artist Lodge (2009); and at Astoria Performing Arts Center (2010.) This past year the festival started producing nationally partnering with theatres who either have playwright-focused or community-based missions: East LA Rep (Los Angeles, CA, Dec 2010), The Playwrights Foundation (San Francisco, CA, Dec 2010), and The New Brunswick Theatre Festival (NJ, Jan 2010.) Festivals are also being planned for Washington, DC, Chicago, and Minneapolis for 2011. \nOver the past 4 years, the New York One Minute Play Festival has produced over 350 new sixty-second plays. Notable alumni include: Rajiv Joseph (2009 Pulitzer Nominee), Kristopher Diaz (2009 Pulitzer Nominee), Michael John Garces (Artistic Director, Cornerstone Theatre, LA), Mike Daisey (famed Monologist), Kyle Jarrow (Obie Award winner), Caridad Svich (Founder, NoPassport), &amp;  Qui Nguyen (Playwright &amp; Co-Artistic Director of the Obie Award Winning, Vampire Cowboys Theatre Company), &amp; Erik Ehn (Head of Playwriting, Brown University.)\nThe New Brunswick Theater Festival's mission is to cultivate a hip, mindful, and inclusive Hub City community of artists and audiences empowered to create inspired and inspiring art by combining exciting, free, professional performances with a dynamic educational outreach component. Since its inception, the New Brunswick Theater Festival has provided free theater to new audiences, given young artists their first glimpse into the world of Shakespeare, and provided young artists with training alongside professional mentors. As we grow we hope you will join us in continuing our mission and helping to stimulate the living and working artistic environment that is New Brunswick, New Jersey.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/the-new-jersey-one-minute-play-festival\/first-production-2011-01-22"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"9352","Date":"January 22, 2011","To Date":"January 23, 2011","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Reading","Latitude":"38.877536","Longitude":"-77.020721","Play title":"Agnes Under the Big Top, a tall tale","Related Play ID":"9344","Generative Artist":"Aditi Brennan Kapil","Artist ID":"9343","Related Theater":"Arena Stage","Related Theater ID":"8220","Event description":"#New Play Festival reading of 'Agnes Under the Big Top, a tall tale'","Synopsis":"Aditi Brennan Kapil&#039;s play AGNES UNDER THE BIG TOP, A TALL TALE was first produced in a National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere at Mixed Blood Theatre (Minneapolis, MN), Long Wharf Theatre (New Haven, CT), and Borderlands (Tucson, AZ) with support from the Continued Life of New Plays Fund.  www.nnpn.org \/\/ Against the subterranean rhythms of a subway train, an itinerant subway busker, a Liberian home care worker, a former Bulgarian ringmaster and his wife, and an Indian call center escapee find and redefine themselves in today\u2019s America.

Cushman continually challenged Victorian notions of gender in her stage portrayals of male characters and of strong, androgynous female characters. Cushman also played the man in every area of her life. She gathered around her an incredible circle of emancipated nineteenth-century women: painters, poets, sculptors and literary women, many of whom she financially supported. She had intense love affairs with several of them.\r\n\r\nFondakowski&#039;s project is based on the collection in the Library of Congress of over 1,000 unpublished letters, written by Cushman to Emma Crow, the transcription of which has been a ten-year labor of love by scholar Lisa Merrill. Many of Cushman&#039;s letters to Crow include the directive: &quot;burn this letter,&quot; but they were not burned. Preserved, they chronicle a passionate Victorian-era lesbian love story before such love was thought to exist.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/casa-cushman\/workshop-2010-11-23"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"14421","Date":"November 21, 2010","To Date":"November 21, 2010","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Reading","Latitude":"40.758343","Longitude":"-73.990152","Play title":"The Tip of the Iceberg (La Aguja del Iceberg)","Related Play ID":"14420","Generative Artist":"Bea Carmina","Artist ID":"14419","Related Theater":"Lark Play Development Center","Related Theater ID":"8699","Event description":"This was a public reading as part of our U.S.\/Mexico Playwright Exchange Program.

James Sugg's portrayal of an introverted botanist is at the center of a dizzying and poignant web of memory, vaudeville, and stories that won't stay straight.\n\u201cThe performance juggles ideas about Chekhov, about playmaking, about what the theater's for, mixing them with bigger matters: love, honesty, friendship, and justice; our relation to nature, to each other, ultimately to ourselves. Nothing's insisted on and little is stated overtly; the show's almost aggressively un-didactic. As with Chekhov, the things we understand from it hang in the atmosphere, articulated but unspoken, engulfing the characters. The result is a kind of exhilarating despair.\u201d -Michael Feingold, Village Voice","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/chekhov-lizardbrain\/presented-performance-2010-10-23"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"32768","Date":"October 22, 2010","To Date":"October 22, 2010","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Reading","Latitude":"40.758343","Longitude":"-73.990152","Play title":"Clementine in the Lower Nine","Related Play ID":"16163","Generative Artist":"Dan Dietz","Artist ID":"16162","Related Theater":"Lark Play Development Center","Related Theater ID":"8699","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/clementine-in-the-lower-nine\/reading-2010-10-22"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"11446","Date":"October 21, 2010","To Date":"October 24, 2010","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Workshop","Latitude":"44.962414","Longitude":"-93.238971","Play title":"Chimera","Related Play ID":"11445","Generative Artist":"Suli Holum and Deborah Stein","Artist ID":"11442","Related Theater":"The Playwrights&#039; Center","Related Theater ID":"8406","Event description":"The PlayLabs 2010 workshop and reading of Suli Holum and Deborah Stein's CHIMERA.","Synopsis":"Welcome to the world of Jennifer Samuels, who has just discovered that she is her own twin.

In the end, the characters\u2019 dreams hang on their ability to cross the line between the certainty of the past and the unknown dream of the future.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/american-dream-el-sueno-del-otro-lado\/reading-2010-08-14"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"8913","Date":"August 13, 2010","To Date":"August 15, 2010","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Workshop","Latitude":"41.308325","Longitude":"-72.931228","Play title":"oPEN","Related Play ID":"8910","Generative Artist":"Martyna Majok","Artist ID":"8909","Related Theater":"Michael Place","Related Theater ID":"8908","Event description":"A weekend of three companies workshopping three plays and then presenting their work to each other.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/open\/workshop-2010-08-13"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"43597","Date":"August 13, 2010","To Date":"August 28, 2010","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Production","Latitude":"44.477485","Longitude":"-73.219923","Play title":"Game Over","Related Play ID":"43591","Generative Artist":"Josh Levine","Artist ID":"34425","Related Theater":"Red Stage Theatre Company","Related Theater ID":"43595","Event description":"The East Coast premiere production.

IVES. Set in a high-end hotel room at The Hague, WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA imagines former President George W. Bush on the eve of his trial for international war crimes. Tended to by an inscrutable Dutch butler and an alluring masseuse, the President embarks on a long night of drinking, joking, and ruminating, taking the audience through a deep exploration of how we regard our leaders - loving them, fearing them, unintentionally deifying them. WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA examines an American populace that has grown strikingly complacent in the wake of extraordinary global challenges, exposing one of the world\u2019s most intriguing and influential conflicts: the battle between the elected leader of the free world and a democracy of millions.

IVES. Set in a high-end hotel room at The Hague, WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA imagines former President George W. Bush on the eve of his trial for international war crimes. Tended to by an inscrutable Dutch butler and an alluring masseuse, the President embarks on a long night of drinking, joking, and ruminating, taking the audience through a deep exploration of how we regard our leaders - loving them, fearing them, unintentionally deifying them. WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA examines an American populace that has grown strikingly complacent in the wake of extraordinary global challenges, exposing one of the world\u2019s most intriguing and influential conflicts: the battle between the elected leader of the free world and a democracy of millions.

As a result, we get a different look at Vincent, a glimpse behind the eyes that first saw the Starry Night...\nAs Bernard recounts their relationship to a student and protege of his own, he reflects on change, growth, faith and beauty, all while looking down the many roads not taken.\nThis script was originally commissioned by Emmanuel College in Franklin Springs, Georgia, where an earlier version of the script premiered in February 2009.

But what if you don't want to go? And just what do you call home when you're all grown up? These are some of the question asked and maybe answered in the play Wise Man, by David J. Loehr.\nGeoffrey Sagemiller is a famous novelist on the cusp of his sixtieth birthday, his greatest work--and his greatest competition--behind him. \"The literary lion in winter,\" as he puts it. He's too old to be young, but too young to be old. Or is he? And what is the difference between maturity and growing up? His daughter Ellen isn't so sure there is one, at least going by Geoffrey's example.\nThe play begins when Geoffrey calls Ellen with urgent news, but asks her to come home before he'll tell her the news. They may be estranged, but some things are more important. So she comes home, only to find everything seems normal, Geoffrey working on his latest novel and his second wife. A second wife not much older than Ellen herself.\nAnd then, he won't tell the big news...\nThis production incorporated Twitter feeds for two of the three main characters, which worked in real time leading up to and following the production.  Geoffrey's tweets were written by David J. Loehr, and those of his young wife were written by Melissa Y. Shaner.  They worked without an outline, using only the script itself as a guide.  This helped to keep the interaction spontaneous and fun.  It may be the earliest use of Twitter as a vehicle for role playing with characters as part of a live theatrical production.","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/wise-man\/first-production-2008-12-18"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"10729","Date":"December 15, 2008","To Date":"January 18, 2009","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Residency","Latitude":"37.785909","Longitude":"-122.403364","Play title":"Andy Warhol: Good for the Jews","Related Play ID":"9577","Generative Artist":"Josh Kornbluth","Artist ID":"8918","Related Theater":"Contemporary Jewish Museum","Related Theater ID":"8914","Event description":"This was the first work on this piece.

They\u2019re just some of the characters showing us around the classical Underworld. Life and death, love and loss, union and reunion, anything can happen in this divine comedy.\nTHE ROUGH GUIDE TO THE UNDERWORLD follows several different stories of people trying to connect with one another, whether as lovers, as family or even as professionals. Some of the stories include:\n\u2013 Clara Clemens searching for her father, Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain\n\u2013 portions of a Ken Burns documentary following a historic expedition to explore the Underworld\n\u2013 a writer named Dante pitching a movie producer on a film about a poet in Hell\u2026\n\u2013 a troubadour with memory problems, and the woman who loves him\u2026who\u2019s always loved him\u2026\n\u2013 a father and son team of explorers, plumb the depths of woe in the waters of the Underworld\nIn the midst of all this, the play also features movie trailers, cooking segments, vacation advertisements, tour guides, figures from mythology and more.\nThe script has been described as \"...something like the Neo-Futurists meet neo-classicism. With Mamet jokes.\"\nBut there's so much more. Arthur Miller jokes. Sartre jokes. And a lot of jokes that have nothing to do with theatre, too.  Comedy, drama, romance, tragedy, music, multimedia, it has a little of everything.\nAnd Mamet

This production won praise from the San Francisco Chronicle: \"The audience is in on something in the making here, as writer-director Trevor Allen concocts a suite of beguiling monologues, quartets and one duet for a company of four absorbing voices.\"\nReview by Steven Winn\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nSeptember 12, 2000\nTrevor Allen's piece soars above festival's other plays\nIt happened at the Morrison Planetarium Sunday night, six hours into a marathon day at the San Francisco Fringe Festival: A piece of real theater broke out. Chain Reactions is just the sort of thing that ought to bloom at this annual festival of risk-taking, noncommercial work -- but so rarely does. This suggestive show about physics, fear and love offers an intelligent, artful sketch of greater things to come. That stands out like an island in a sea of amateur auteurism, campy self-indulgence and earnest confessional monologues.\nFor 50 minutes at the planetarium, at least, the odds could be forgotten. The audience is in on something in the making here, as writer-director Trevor Allen concocts a suite of beguiling monologues, quartets and one duet for a company of four absorbing voices.\nThe first section, \"Synchronicity,\" begins with a rather dense overture delivered by a physicist (Ellen Koivisto). Then a street bookseller-panhandler (Kieron Edwards) chimes in with his more earthbound philosophy: \"A buck for a book,\" he growls. They're joined by the delightfully crusty Helen Slayton Hughes as a skeptical woman being romanced by a poet in a bar and the becalmed Paul Gerrior as a professor.\nThe four voices overlap, diverge and fuse in the ensemble's choral interplay. Then Allen takes his verbal fugues apart and lets us hear the voices on their own. The speaker's quirks and unintended connections to other realities wink in and out of view.\nThe drifting, musical quality of Chain Reactions is enhanced by the setting. Stars float across the planetarium's domed ceiling, studded now and then by photo-illustrations that mark each section like silent epigrams. The amplified voices echo soothingly in the space.\nSlayton-Hughes plays Einstein, and Edwards is his wartime nuclear physicist colleague Leo Szilard in the anguished if somewhat stiffer middle section.\nPart 3, \"The Mistaken Variations,\" turns the disparate imagery of stoplights, a bachelor's fishbowl, a coma and pregnancy into a ravishing meditation on life's patterns and uncertainties.\nThough Chain Reactions benefits from the planetarium's light-speckled sky and spacey acoustics, the show hews to the Fringe Festival's mobile, low-tech principles. The actors work at music stands without props or scenery or even much movement. It's the language and ideas that soar.\nFull San Francisco Chronicle review here:  http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/cgi-bin\/article.cgi?f=\/c\/a\/2000\/09\/12\/DD110004.DTL","Synopsis":"Three interwoven fugue-like stories are held together by a young physicist who is a mother-to-be.
