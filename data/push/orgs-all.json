In 2005, the OHT reorganized its emerging artists programming under the name Ontological-Hysteric Incubator. The Incubator is programming that guides artists from workshop phases to fully realized productions. The Incubator houses artists, who follow in the compositional theater footsteps of Foreman, but have their own unique visions and strategies for unsettling perception and disorienting understanding.

Those of us who consider ourselves dramatists take it as crucial to be able to organize our imaginations in such a way as to change any location into a theater. . . to reflect upon theater is to reflect upon the city.\"\n    \u2013SHUJI TERAYAMA \u201cManifesto\u201d The Drama Review, December 1975\nSkewed Visions specializes in site-specific performance. We create work that embraces site as an endlessly stimulating element of performance. Our performances respond to many aspects of a site and transform the experience of space: its physical characteristics, social context and history, its function and the people who use the site or happen to be there. We believe that any place can become a theatrical space. Our mission is to change, with our works, the \u201clandscape of daily life.\u201d\nSkewed Visions is also dedicated to expanding notions of performance through interdisciplinary collaboration as well as actor and audience education and development. Our creative processes are interdisciplinary and open; roles such as director, writer and actor are fluid. We seek to educate local artists and audiences while collaborating with unique local and internationally acclaimed artists and performers.\nSkewed Visions was founded in 1996 by Charles Campbell, G\u00fclg\u00fcn Kayim and Sean Kelley-Pegg.","Organization type":"Producing","Latitude":"45.005094","Longitude":"-93.254555","Special interests":"Devised, Experimental, International, Multidisciplinary, New Work","Local networks":"Minnesota Theater Alliance"}},{"node":{"Org ID":"12887","Path":"\/organization\/humble-play-new-play-festival-of-appalachia-ohio","Org name":"Humble Play: New Play Festival of Appalachia Ohio","Ensemble collective":"Single Entity","Founding date":"2006","Logo":"sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/org_icon\/imagefield_default_images\/default-user-icon.png","Mission statement":"It is the mission of Humble Play: New Play Festival of Appalachia Ohio to promote the art of playwriting while introducing the process of play development to an audience.  this is achieved by inviting playwrights to submit their new plays to a committee of judges.

Housed in a charming two-story complex in Hollywood, California, the Fountain has grown into one of the most successful of the smaller venues in the busy Los Angeles theatre world. With the addition of Producing Director\/Dramaturg Simon Levy (in 1993), the Fountain Theatre has an artistic staff with a wealth of experience that is quickly bringing the theatre's work to the attention of larger and larger audiences.","Organization type":"Producing","Latitude":"34.095224","Longitude":"-118.299930","Special interests":"African-American, Contemporary, Multicultural, New Work, Political\/Social","Local networks":"Los Angeles Stage Alliance","National networks":"National New Play Network (NNPN), Theatre Communications Group"}},{"node":{"Org ID":"11481","Path":"\/organization\/sf-playhouse","Org name":"SF Playhouse","Ensemble collective":"Single Entity","Founding date":"2003","Logo":"sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/org_icon\/imagefield_default_images\/default-user-icon.png","Mission statement":"To create and sustain an intimate, professional theatrical community where we celebrate our shared human experience through compelling productions of premieres and re-invigorated classics that resonate for our times and inspire.","Organization type":"Producing","Latitude":"37.789162","Longitude":"-122.410017","Special interests":"African-American, Contemporary, Ensemble, Gay\/Lesbian, Jewish, Latino\/Hispanic, Multicultural, Multidisciplinary, Musicals, New Work, Political\/Social, Women"}},{"node":{"Org ID":"11386","Path":"\/organization\/colored-girl-productions","Org name":"Colored Girl Productions","Ensemble collective":"Single Entity","Founding date":"2004","Logo":"sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/org_icon\/gcplogofinal.jpg","Mission statement":"Founded in 2004, Colored Girl Productions (CGP) is a non-profit\norganization dedicated to producing new works and classic plays\ninfluenced by the African Diaspora for young people and their families.\nCGP\u2019s mission is to increase the scope and impact of the American\nTheatre by accessing, educating and reaching urban youth with plays\ncommissioned by significant playwrights, developed and produced\nespecially for this audience.","Organization type":{"1":"Development","2":"Producing"},"Latitude":"40.106376","Longitude":"-75.123248","Special interests":"African-American, Musicals, New Work, Touring, Young Audiences"}},{"node":{"Org ID":"11367","Path":"\/organization\/pangea-world-theater","Org name":"Pangea World Theater","Ensemble collective":"Single Entity","Founding date":"1995","Logo":"sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/org_icon\/imagefield_default_images\/default-user-icon.png","Mission statement":"Pangea World Theater illuminates the human condition, celebrates cultural differences, and promotes human rights by creating and presenting international, multi-disciplinary theater.","Organization type":{"1":"Presenting","2":"Producing"},"Latitude":"44.948122","Longitude":"-93.288820","Special interests":"African-American, Asian-American, Classical, Contemporary, Ensemble, Experimental, Gay\/Lesbian, International, Latino\/Hispanic, Multicultural, Multidisciplinary, Native American, New Work, Political\/Social, Student\/Youth, Touring, Translations\/Adaptations, Women"}},{"node":{"Org ID":"11326","Path":"\/organization\/trinity-repertory-company","Org name":"Trinity Repertory Company","Ensemble collective":"Single Entity","Founding date":"1964","Logo":"sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/org_icon\/imagefield_default_images\/default-user-icon.png","Mission statement":"Trinity Rep produces exceptional dramatic experiences and related programs, created by, for and about our community.

We develop, produce, and present experimental work in the performing, literary, visual and interdisciplinary arts and we support Bay Area artists through residencies, fiscal sponsorship, incubation, networking, and consulting programs. Intersection\u2019s mission is vested in the notion that art can provide powerful opportunities for people to exchange ideas and perspectives, encourage us to respond more critically to the world, and reach for a future that is more hopeful, more inclusive and more tolerant.\n\u2022 Overview\/Activities: Widely considered to be one of the most vital multicultural centers in the Bay Area, Intersection is well-known for its commitment to emphasizing the process of art-making and creating space and time for artists and audience members to come together to imagine and create new cultural experiments that aim to transform our world. Intersection\u2019s multidisciplinary service, support, producing and presenting programs cross the disciplines and include an array of Artist Residencies designed to nurture long-term relationships with Bay Area artists and ensembles including Campo Santo Theatre Company, and the ESP Project; Jazz At Intersection featuring an extraordinary array of local musicians and composers including Howard Wiley and Marcus Shelby; The Hybrid Project \u2013 an experimental performance program with resident company the Living Word Project; a comprehensive Visual Arts\/Gallery Program; and the Literary Program which is the oldest independent reading series in the state and works with writers who challenge social and aesthetic barriers. Currently, the Intersection Incubator provides fiscal sponsorship and support to more than 120 projects involving thousands of people each year.\nOver its 45 year history, Intersection's theatre has played a pivotal role in the development of new American Theatre and the cultivation of diverse new audiences. The organization\u2019s specific contributions to the field include the support and incubation of countless important artists and emerging theatre organizations that continue to have lasting impact across the country; the incubation and production of numerous groundbreaking pieces of American Theatre that continue to set standards today; and the development and articulation of models for creating new work and cultivating young and diverse audiences. Additionally, Intersection is the home base for many of San Francisco\u2019s most regarded theatre artists and with our Resident Theatre Company Campo Santo alone we hold the distinction of developing and premiering more than 50 theatre and performance works in the past 10 years. Many of these works have received critical acclaim, won awards, and gone on to have life in other parts of the country. Following are select examples: 1973: Acclaimed writer, comedian and activist Don Novello introduces his character Father Guido Sarducci at Intersection for the first time. 1980: Intersection founds and produces The San Francisco International Theatre Festival. George Coates, Artistic Director, calls the festival a unique sampling of \u201cthe one world community of non-ordinary theatre.\u201d As part of the Festival, solo performer Spalding Gray presents three new monologues. 1983: Intersection launches a Midnight Series of experimental work. Whoopi Goldberg, Geoff Hoyle, David Barrett and El Teatro Campesino are among the artists to try out new work on the Intersection stage. 1984: Intersection invites A Traveling Jewish Theatre to spend three months in residence to develop its powerful ensemble piece Dance of Exile exploring the Kaballah and human isolation. The residency tradition carries forward thru today and is a hallmark of Intersection\u2019s vision. 1987: Karen Finley performs her first major solo piece, The Constant State of Desire. Also, multi-media pioneer Guillermo Gomez-Pe\u00f1a perform the interdisciplinary work, Califas at Intersection. 1988: Vanguard choreographer and director Joe Goode launches his unique career with the first segment of The Disaster Series. Also, famed theatrical trio Culture Clash premieres their first full-length theatre production, The Mission, at Intersection. 1996 Intersection welcomes the Bay Area\u2019s most promising young company, Campo Santo, to participate in a new theater residency program. This potent collaboration results in a widely acclaimed model for creating new American Theatre and cultivating new audiences. Today, we have developed and premiered 40 new plays and 25 interdisciplinary performance works by some of this country\u2019s most important writers including Dave Eggers, Philip Kan Gotanda, Denis Johnson, Jessica Hagedorn, Naomi Iizuka, Octavio Solis, Erin Cressida Wilson, Vendela Vida and plays created from the novels of Junot Diaz and Adam Mansbach.\nCommunity: Intersection serves approximately 20,000 people each year (12,000 audience members, 300 members, 120 Incubator projects and their audiences, 30 Community Partners, and more). Our recent surveys have shown that 70% of the people who come to Intersection are people of color and 70% are between the ages of 16 and 40. Our efforts to reach and involve people are integral to our organization. We view each new art project as an opportunity to reach out to and involve new communities as partners in the process of developing the work. We take the themes, stories, communities and issues that each artist is addressing to identify and engage new communities through partnerships, events, and projects that are relevant to their lives. Over the years we have developed an organic process for creating new plays that has allowed us to build a very diverse constituency made up of committed collaborators and loyal audience members. This process simultaneously balances and integrates the particular needs of the artistic collaborators with an institutional commitment to reach and involve new people in the projects as they are coming alive, to build community partnerships, and to create programs and activities that allow people to contribute and respond creatively to the issues, stories, and themes we are grappling with.","Organization type":"Producing","Latitude":"37.782487","Longitude":"-122.406591","Special interests":"Contemporary, Ensemble, Multicultural, New Work, Political\/Social","Local networks":"Californians for the Arts, Theatre Bay Area","National networks":"Theatre Comminications Group"}},{"node":{"Org ID":"11029","Path":"\/organization\/second-stage-theatre","Org name":"Second Stage Theatre","Ensemble collective":"Single Entity","Founding date":"1979","Logo":"sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/org_icon\/imagefield_default_images\/default-user-icon.png","Mission statement":"Director Carole Rothman and actress Robyn Goodman founded Second Stage Theatre in 1979 to give 'second stagings' to contemporary American plays that originally failed to find an audience due to scheduling problems, inappropriate venues or limited performance runs.
