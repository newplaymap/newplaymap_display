Set in the years 1513-16 in and around Florence, we follow the life of Machiavelli, a one-time political insider now thrown out of the city. Exiled from everything but his beloved library of Greek and Roman texts, he endeavors to find his way back in to favor through the writing of a handbook for the Prince, but is unable to get any serious attention. Unexpectedly, Machiavelli's way off the blacklist turns out to be via the stage and the writing of a comedy. Throughout, it is his complex relationship to the women in his life -- wife, daughter, mistress, goddess -- that determines his true failure or success. The play features elements of Machiavelli's writings from the THE PRINCE and THE MANDRAGOLA, as well as from works\n by Savonorola, Pico della Mirandola, Lucretius, Plautus, Hippocrates, Galen, and others -- and music from, among others, Verdelot and Kay Starr.\nSaturday, February 11, 2012 - 8:00 PM\nSunday, February 12, 2012 - 2:30 PM\nThursday, February 16, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSaturday, February 18, 2012 - 2:30 PM\nWednesday, February 22, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSaturday, February 25, 2012 - 8:00 PM\nFriday, March 02, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSunday, March 04, 2012 - 2:30 PM","Path":"\/newplay\/newplaymap_private\/www\/play\/fortune-is-a-woman\/first-production-2012-02-11"}},{"node":{"Event ID":"26478","Date":"February 10, 2012","To Date":"February 18, 2012","Content Type":"Event","Event type":"Production","Latitude":"61.217061","Longitude":"-149.894342","Play title":"The Blue Bear","Related Play ID":"26454","Generative Artist":"Luan Schooler &amp; Leon Ingulsrud","Artist ID":"26453","Related Theater":"Perseverance Theatre, Inc","Related Theater ID":"26449","Event description":"Second production and kick off of Perseverance Theatre's Anchorage season.","Synopsis":"In 1990, author Lynn Schooler was a guide in Juneau when he met the Japanese wildlife photographer, Michio Hoshino.

When his wife Ruby, a nurse, attempts to help solve some of the problems that George\u2019s shortcomings are starting to create for their marriage, it only makes matters worse.  But when George and Ruby are suddenly surprised by the arrival of their daughter Nia from college with her new fianc\u00e9e Joseph, a young poet and budding novelist who is failing to channel his own machismo (physically, aesthetically, and in his sensibilities) in Nia\u2019s undying opinion , the Evans household becomes a powder-keg in which conflicting ideals of masculinity ignite an explosion of conflict between its four inhabitants.\n\"Kind of Blue\" is a part of Stewart's \"Companion Play Cycle\", eight distinct groups of plays, with five plays in each group, written as companion pieces to eight distinct forms of jazz including Dixieland, Swing, Bebop, Cool, Hard Bop, Modal, Free and Fusion. For each group of plays, Stewart takes any combination of aesthetic, technicality, and context in which a particular jazz style was created and uses that combination to create a dramatic structure or dramatic narrative for a play. The Companion Play Cycle was inspired by August Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle which paid homage to a contextualized experience, the categorically threaded of plays of William Shakespeare via the First Folio, and the desire to explore the most provocative existential questions through dramatic societal critique akin to Edward Albee. \n\"Kind of Blue\" is the first of the five Modal Plays in the Companion Play Cycle written as a companion piece to the style of Modal Jazz. The dramatic structure of \"Kind of Blue\" is born out of the technicality of Modal Jazz which employed the use of scales which were colloquially called \"modes\". While also being the namesake of the Modal Jazz album by Miles Davis, \"Kind of Blue\" explores different \"modes\" of masculinity and examines how varying understandings of male roles in society affects interpersonal relationship through a gritty and naturalistic drama. \nALL BY INVITATION ONLY!\nTo request an invitation, email RTC@RitualTheatreCompany.org","Synopsis":"In early 1940s New York City, George Evans (a middle-aged bartender) is beginning to struggle mightily with the patriarchal role he has been seeking his entire life.

This summer is its third residency at Ko.\nThe idea of an ensemble came about during a development residency in 2009 when the lead artists asked a handful of college-aged interns at the Ko Festival of Performance in Amherst to read some letters in translation, and then proposed exercises for them to play with on stage. They not only enjoyed reading the letters, but also helped Katie and Ellen answer questions about the play that they had begun to explore as a two-person piece. Enlivened by our commerce with them, they began to incorporate the ensemble into the work. The idea -- initially an accidental encounter -- has become a cornerstone of both the play\u2019s development and its structure. At its center, the play now has a group of young actors that is at times a chorus and at times a modern ensemble. They create the world in which we present the letters, individually play the letter writer at moments, and narrate their own exploration of the character and the century.","Synopsis":"INDUSTRIOUS ANGELS is a solo hand-crafted-story-spinning-shadow-puppet-memory-play-with-music evoking the secret creative lives of women, mother\/daughter bloodlines, and the ghost of Emily Dickinson.In a shadowed attic, crammed with curio cabinets, work tables, chests and drawers (containers for mementos and unmentionables), a daughter searches for what it is that ties together her mother, herself, and an elusive poet.
