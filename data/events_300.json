Part haunted house, part adventure novel, full of theatricality, mysterious characters, and physical feats, \"A Terrific Fire\" was developed with support from Rhode Island\u2019s Perishable Theatre and Alaska\u2019s Perseverance Theatre.",

Set in the years 1513-16 in and around Florence, we follow the life of Machiavelli, a one-time political insider now thrown out of the city. Exiled from everything but his beloved library of Greek and Roman texts, he endeavors to find his way back in to favor through the writing of a handbook for the Prince, but is unable to get any serious attention. Unexpectedly, Machiavelli's way off the blacklist turns out to be via the stage and the writing of a comedy. Throughout, it is his complex relationship to the women in his life -- wife, daughter, mistress, goddess -- that determines his true failure or success. The play features elements of Machiavelli's writings from the THE PRINCE and THE MANDRAGOLA, as well as from works\n by Savonorola, Pico della Mirandola, Lucretius, Plautus, Hippocrates, Galen, and others -- and music from, among others, Verdelot and Kay Starr.\nSaturday, February 11, 2012 - 8:00 PM\nSunday, February 12, 2012 - 2:30 PM\nThursday, February 16, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSaturday, February 18, 2012 - 2:30 PM\nWednesday, February 22, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSaturday, February 25, 2012 - 8:00 PM\nFriday, March 02, 2012 - 7:00 PM\nSunday, March 04, 2012 - 2:30 PM",

Harry, an unemployed Wall Street Broker, dreams of success by literally\nconquering what he fears: China &amp; its economy.

China to\nHudson has been developed in collaborative between Concrete Temple Theatre, Sirovich Senior Center\nand is part of Dixon Place's Cultural Education &amp; Community Outreach Program, supported by NYSCA and\nDCA.\nSupport for Hudson to China comes from: a commission by the Hudson Opera House with funds from the\nNew York State Council for the Arts as well as Concrete Temple Theatre's support from NYSCA and New\nYork City Department of Cultural Affairs, in addition to a Jim Henson Foundation Project Grant and Dixon\nPlace\u2019s Puppet Blok.",

Point of Contention continues its tradition of providing new or little-known plays to the Chicago community with this story of a girl who has a chance to either change or make the \u201csafe choice.\u201d\nAll the Girls Love Bobby Kennedy follows the story of college student Gracie B. and her experience of the turmoil of the late 1960\u2019s. At that time, for many people Bobby Kennedy was the embodiment of optimism. Here, Kennedy appears as the hopeful side of Grace\u2019s conscience and just the thing she needs to break free of the status quo. While hope builds and life-changing choices are being considered, a war rages on the other side of the world, and one gun shot at a hotel in California is about to stun a generation.\nAll the Girls Love Bobby Kennedy is directed by Rachel Staelens, assistant directed by Brandon Baisden and features the work of Elee Schrock as Grace, Jordan Phelps as Bobby Kennedy, Lauren Bourke as Sylvie, Todd Aiello as John/Jimmy, and Matt Tassell as Joe.

Set in an Upper East Side Manhattan apartment during a birthday party, the evening begins as a hilarious and spirited celebration among friends. It\u2019s all laughs, until an unexpected guest, too much alcohol and a truth-telling game reveal tensions that rip open the men's souls.\nThe Boys in the Band is directed by convergence-continuum company member Tyson Douglas Rand. The casting is not the conventional take on the play, which has all the characters in their late twenties and early thirties. The convergence-continuum production portrays a more age-diverse group of friends, in part bridging the 43-year gap between 1968 and today, and features actors Curt Arnold, Benjamin Gregg, Zac Hudak, Jim Jarrell, Dan Kilbane, Clyde Simon, Jonathan Wilhelm, Bobby Williams and Scott Zolkowski.\nThe Boys in the Band opens Friday, Oct 7 and runs at 8pm Thursdays, Fridays &amp; Saturdays thru Oct 29 at the Liminis, 2438 Scranton Rd, Cleveland, OH in the historic Tremont neighborhood. Tix are $15 general admission, $12 for seniors (65+) &amp; $10 for students. Reservations and info are available at 216-687-0074 &amp; www.convergence-continuum.org.",

It\u2019s a gritty, playful attempt to translate the pacing and thrill of visually-driven cinema narratives like Dirty Harry and The French Connection into acrobatically poetic language for the stage.  It's rollercoaster ride through a brand of edgy feminism that's super-duper not-boring.  Above all, it\u2019s a tale about a hunter who is driven to chase his prey, even when the cost to himself may be beyond measure.  For more, http://www.sfolympians.com/?page_id=502",

The point is to give modern audiences a similar reference to what Moliere&#039;s audiences had with the characters and plots of commedia dell&#039;arte. (Truffle is a angel-faced young man on a bicycle, Elmyra finds him oddly attractive.) The script is in large part my own, though, it follows Moliere&#039;s story line and, especially in the earlier scenes, mirrors the flow of dialogue.  It was first produced in an earlier version by Studio III Group in NYC in 1991.",

In early March, 1906, Angeline, just turned sixteen, bids provincial life \u201cGood-bye\u201d by boarding The Bernhardt Special. However, Papa\u2019s spilled secret about her long deceased mother replaces romantic fantasies with visions of a dangerous future and forces her to reconsider the adventure. Wayne Chapman, Department of Theatre &amp; Dance at UALR, directs the cast of 5 men and 4 women; Bob Boury, Music Department at UALR, plays original ragtime music during the performances. Reservations required for free tickets.",
      "synopsis" : "At sixteen in 1906, Angeline Sullivan seizes the chance be a maid serving Sarah Bernhardt in Little Rock, Arkansas, a stop on her tour across America. Heady to meet the romantic actress and frustrated with the mystery of her late mother, Angeline decides to board Bernhardt\u2019s train and see New York, place of her birth and Mama\u2019s death. Observing her bumbling work, the cook Henry discourages her plan, but even when caught with Bernhardt\u2019s leading man by the star and Papa, Angeline begs to join the entourage. Despite Papa\u2019s desperate revelations, Angeline packs her valise and asks Henry\u2019s help at the station. His voice is most persuasive in the drama swirling around her, as he tells her to fold family secrets into a safely \u201cdull\u201d life or risk a precarious existence outside any community.

The action of the play often shifts back and forth between the two stories until, at the end, the two candidates debate and the audience votes for their favorite. After the audience vote, the candidates give a victory or concession speech based on the results of the audience vote.",

      "event_description" : "A staged reading of \"Kind of Blue\", a new play by Kuamel Stewart who is a twenty one year-old new and emerging playwright.\n In early 1940s New York City, George Evans (a middle-aged bartender) is beginning to struggle mightily with the patriarchal role (professionally, sexually, psychologically, and domestically) he has been seeking his entire life.  When his wife Ruby, a nurse, attempts to help solve some of the problems that George\u2019s shortcomings are starting to create for their marriage, it only makes matters worse.  But when George and Ruby are suddenly surprised by the arrival of their daughter Nia from college with her new fiancée Joseph, a young poet and budding novelist who is failing to channel his own machismo (physically, aesthetically, and in his sensibilities) in Nia\u2019s undying opinion , the Evans household becomes a powder-keg in which conflicting ideals of masculinity ignite an explosion of conflict between its four inhabitants.\n\"Kind of Blue\" is a part of Stewart's \"Companion Play Cycle\", eight distinct groups of plays, with five plays in each group, written as companion pieces to eight distinct forms of jazz including Dixieland, Swing, Bebop, Cool, Hard Bop, Modal, Free and Fusion. For each group of plays, Stewart takes any combination of aesthetic, technicality, and context in which a particular jazz style was created and uses that combination to create a dramatic structure or dramatic narrative for a play. The Companion Play Cycle was inspired by August Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle which paid homage to a contextualized experience, the categorically threaded of plays of William Shakespeare via the First Folio, and the desire to explore the most provocative existential questions through dramatic societal critique akin to Edward Albee. \n\"Kind of Blue\" is the first of the five Modal Plays in the Companion Play Cycle written as a companion piece to the style of Modal Jazz. The dramatic structure of \"Kind of Blue\" is born out of the technicality of Modal Jazz which employed the use of scales which were colloquially called \"modes\". While also being the namesake of the Modal Jazz album by Miles Davis, \"Kind of Blue\" explores different \"modes\" of masculinity and examines how varying understandings of male roles in society affects interpersonal relationship through a gritty and naturalistic drama. \nALL BY INVITATION ONLY!\nTo request an invitation, email RTC@RitualTheatreCompany.org",

With only a year left together, they decide to live those 12 months as though they were the 60 years they would have had together, creating a world around themselves of rapidly changing seasons and tiny moments of stillness. This mixed-media folk opera explores the mutability of time and pushes boundaries in music and theater through the combination of The Bengsons' critically acclaimed original music.",

When Bagayan\u2019s image and academic struggles come to question, Bagayan learns that being a professional athlete is about much more than just playing the sport he worked hard to master.

      "synopsis" : "This play explores the idea that six jobs are necessary for hominid culture: food for physical survival, help for care of the body, tools for some physical mastery of the environment, laws for mastery over ourselves, vision (including religion and art) to give us reasons to submit to laws, and information so we can build on what we learn.  Each scene focuses on one of these jobs in near-future environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are 9 female characters and 4 male characters, requiring a minimum cast (with doubling) of 6 females and 2 males.  It is a full-length piece, approx running time 90 minutes, with a large amount of fight choreography involving most of the characters.  The settings are fairly bare, with scenes both indoors and outside; this piece would do well with a minimal number of set pieces that can be rearranged to suggest the different setting, or as an immersion piece where the audience is led from location to location.\r\n\r\nRead by Terry Bamberger, Rebecca Leiner, Angelina Llongueras, Dorothy Loyola, Katja Rivera, Linda Wang, Romolo Wilkinson, and Dan Wilson.",

STRANGER THINGS leaves us with the question: Can we atone for the missteps in our past or are we forever bound to the fate those steps unleash?",

The BAPF brings together a select group of playwrights and artistic teams of professional directors, dramaturgs and actors who engage in an in-depth development process over three weeks every summer which includes a three-day artistic retreat, 20+ hours of studio time and dramaturgical discussions. The work leads to two public staged readings of each play, separated by a week of additional rehearsals to provide for the incorporation of rewrites and staging. The BAPF is dedicated to advancing the work of contemporary writers, with a mandate to include a diverse group of newly emerging writers, writers of color, women and men, and writers with a wide range of style and aesthetic. Work developed on the annual festival has often advanced to productions across the country in subsequent years, becoming an integral part of the landscape of evolving U.S. theater.",

The BAPF brings together a select group of playwrights and artistic teams of professional directors, dramaturgs and actors who engage in an in-depth development process over three weeks every summer which includes a three-day artistic retreat, 20+ hours of studio time and dramaturgical discussions. The work leads to two public staged readings of each play, separated by a week of additional rehearsals to provide for the incorporation of rewrites and staging. The BAPF is dedicated to advancing the work of contemporary writers, with a mandate to include a diverse group of newly emerging writers, writers of color, women and men, and writers with a wide range of style and aesthetic. Work developed on the annual festival has often advanced to productions across the country in subsequent years, becoming an integral part of the landscape of evolving U.S. theater.",

This summer is its third residency at Ko.\nThe idea of an ensemble came about during a development residency in 2009 when the lead artists asked a handful of college-aged interns at the Ko Festival of Performance in Amherst to read some letters in translation, and then proposed exercises for them to play with on stage. They not only enjoyed reading the letters, but also helped Katie and Ellen answer questions about the play that they had begun to explore as a two-person piece. Enlivened by our commerce with them, they began to incorporate the ensemble into the work. The idea -- initially an accidental encounter -- has become a cornerstone of both the play\u2019s development and its structure. At its center, the play now has a group of young actors that is at times a chorus and at times a modern ensemble. They create the world in which we present the letters, individually play the letter writer at moments, and narrate their own exploration of the character and the century.",

A wounded soldier recently returned from the war in Iraq, she shares her story while driving along the Long Island Expressway. Passengers in the car are her father a veteran of the Vietnam War and her deceased uncle. All of them suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. All of them have kept silent about war. One of them has committed vehicular suicide, the others must decide if they will break the silence or follow the same path. The central character comes from a long line of Black soldiers. She is the first woman to see serve in combat. The complexities of her experience are explored thru digital media, music and text. The CBT ensemble that will complete the work consists of four core CBT ensemble actors, the playwright Linda Parris-Bailey, the director/dramaturge Andrea Assaf, visual artists Melody Reeve, an independent artist and educator.  Her work incorporates a fetishistic devotion to object making, video and text development with a long history of social practice specifically engaged with community based social justice organizations, and Vietnam consultant Umoja Abdul Ahad. Lighting design is by Darron McCroom.  \nWith funding from the National Performance Network and co-commissioners, Junebug Productions and Mason-Rhynes Productions, this important work is scheduled for completion in early 2012.",

Rushing home to console his parents, he suspects a strange conspiracy between them to keep Ed from the truth.  Jimmy's girlfriend, Kassie, and Jim's best friend Lonnie, lead Ed on a journey into the darker parts of Jimmy's life, eventually leading to what his friends suspect was his accidental death from autoerotic asphyxiation.\nConfronting his parents with his suspicions, Ed forces them to recount the discovery of Jimmy's body.  Too embarrassed to admit the truth to anyone other than Ed, his parents steadfastly hold to the story that Jimmy killed himself, more willing to assume the role of parents of a suicidal teenager, than to face the disgrace of telling the public that their son accidentally died while masturbating.  Ed struggles with his relationship with God, his love for his parents and his dead brother, and most of all, the truth, as he tries to minister to his family and somehow find the common ground between truth and compassion.",
