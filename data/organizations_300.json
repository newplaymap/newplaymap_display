The Pig Iron Theatre Company is a collection of individuals who engage one another in a critical dialogue about the joys and difficulties of our world and who subscribe to similar artistic values. We strive to make the impossible possible on stage. The language Pig Iron uses to communicate with its audience is a language of gesture, word, color, the rhythm of the body and the rhythm of objects in space; it is a language of surprise and of transformation that is constantly evolving.",

PPL's projects are developed in collaboration with individuals from many different walks of life, and often through community workshops, interviews, and other engaged practices. They often examine complex systems and trace epistemic, emotional, and socio-political viewpoints held by individuals and groups using music, text, home-made technological set-ups, multiple languages, video, interactive and participatory elements, field-recorded sound, and found materials. Our core practice is currently the creation of \"documentary performance art operas.\" PPL has shown work in New York City at Dixon Place, University Settlement, The Brick Theater, The cell, Gathering of the Tribes Gallery, ABC No Rio, Spread Art, The West End Theater, The Hudson Guild Theater, the Manhattan Theatre Source, Judson Church, Surreal Estate, Studio Maya, IRT, The Brecht Forum, The Brooklyn Arts Exchange, The Battle Ranch, 14 Wall Street (Workforce/Forced Work through Swing Space) two chashama spaces, in a pop-up gallery through QMAD, at the LaGuardia Performing Arts Center (LAB residency), BOB the Pavilion at Columbia University, during SUPERFRONT's Public Summer at Industry City, and during FIGMENT, and in bars and parking lots, on the Theresienwiese where the Oktoberfest is held in Munich, Germany, above a mall in Goshen, Indiana, in parkinglots, on rooftops, and many other spaces and sites elsewhere. In conjunction with and sometimes as performance projects, PPL also organizes conferences, workshops, and other public platforms for critical analysis, synthesis, and debate and collaborates with artists and organizations all over the world.",

Mitchell Turner produced their collaborative script Patriot Act III: Rise of the Machines and wound up starting a theater company in the process. In 2004 we set about incorporating and obtaining 501(c)(3) status as a non-profit organization.\nIn developing our collective shows, Sansculottes write collaboratively. We sit around a table, and each of us writes six lines of a scene. Then we pass our scenes to the right, and each person must continue writing whatever scene he or she has received. It\u2019s not unlike improvising on paper; each person contributes to every scene.\nBagby describes our writing process in more detail in her essay \u201cSomehow, the Scenes Still Happen,\u201d which Lisa Rosenthal included in her excellent anthology The Writing Group Book (Chicago Review Press, 2003). A different version of the essay\u2014with a scene annotated to show how the process works\u2014appears in the November 2004 issue of Dramatics magazine.",

Deconstruction and \"violation\" of sacred texts while maintaining plot and character;\n5. Respect for the artist's time and talent;\n6. Environmental staging in nontraditional locations whenever feasible;\n7.

We create and present pieces that are a springboard for community dialogue, ones that consider themes and issues vital to our civic and personal lives.\nTHE KO FESTIVAL OF PERFORMANCE, a program of Ko Theater Works, presents original works that surprise, provoke and inspire our audiences and ourselves. By presenting works by core company members and guest artists, we foster the collaborations and experiments in form that define the core of our mission, which is to provide unusual and exciting entertainment for our community in the Pioneer Valley, while we are developing new creative relationships among the diverse community of innovative local, national and international artists.\nEach summer our Festival is centered on a theme such as \u201cStories of Illness and Healing\u201d or \u201cThe Immigrant\u2019s Journey.\u201d Performances are accompanied by facilitated discussions and lobby displays that contextualize the ideas presented in the work in an effort to engender inter-audience/artist exchange and provide opportunities for civic dialogue.\nThe Ko Festival also offers a unique array of 6-day workshops where adults, both local and national, can study techniques and approaches to making new work with master teachers. Other activities include internships, and rehearsal residencies where individual artists or ensembles can develop new work or reconsider older pieces in their repertoire.",

What if there were no fourth wall? What if, instead of going to the theatre to watch a play, you crossed the threshold into the world of the play to experience it? Theatre that expands the imagination and extends the conventional boundaries of language, structure, space, and performance that challenges the conventional notions of what theatre is.

We enable playwrights to hear their work read aloud by professional actors and before a small audience by presenting up to 17 works a year in our Reading Series, hold developmental workshops for new plays and musicals, and award three or four commissions to playwrights every year. Playwrights Horizons is also committed to training the next generation of theater professionals, both on and off the stage. Our Theater School, affiliated with New York University, trains more than 200 students each year, and our Resident Internship Program brings aspiring arts professionals to Playwrights Horizons to work with our production, literary, casting, development and marketing staff.

A further exploration of this phenomenon revealed that just as youth seldom ventured outside of Watts, many people outside of Watts never visit. We as a company began to wonder why this is the case and what we can do theatrically to address this issue. As we have explored and meditated on this isolation we realized that it is a metaphor for the way many people and organizations exist. How many times we find ourselves in a community but never strive to become part of it. It is our hope to have Meet Me @ Metro become an annual series of performances and to expand this as an annual festival aboard various routes on the Metro, with the series of performances always concluding in Watts.

Larry Reed is one of the few Americans to be trained in wayang kulit, Balinese shadow puppetry and performed in this tradition around the world over the last 35 years. In the early 1990's, Reed began expanding the scope of ShadowLights artistic activities and invented an ingenious shadow casting method, which integrates the traditional shadow theatre techniques, cinematic effects and modern theatre and dance styles. Truly multidisciplinary and performed behind and in front of a large screen (15ft x 30ft), our original works employ specially-designed projectors to cast silhouettes of puppets, actors, and cutout sets, all of which are manipulated to create astonishingly cinematic effects live on stage. Each show features live music and is created by a collaborating ensemble of writers, choreographers, composers, designers, actors, dancers, musicians and puppeteers from the various performing arts traditions such as Chinese, Tibetan, Indonesian, Japanese, Filipino and Latin American.",

The OHT seeks to produce works that balance a primitive and minimal style with extremely complex and theatrical themes. The core of the company's annual programming is Richard Foreman's theater pieces, of which he has made over 50 in the last 40 years. Since taking up its home at the Ontological Theater at St. Mark's in 1992, the OHT has also been nurturing a new generation of artists who share Foreman's goals and passion for theater. Through internship, staffing, summer residency and curatorial efforts, the OHT has been a starting point for many artists making their mark in New York City and internationally. In 2005, the OHT reorganized its emerging artists programming under the name Ontological-Hysteric Incubator. The Incubator is programming that guides artists from workshop phases to fully realized productions. The Incubator houses artists, who follow in the compositional theater footsteps of Foreman, but have their own unique visions and strategies for unsettling perception and disorienting understanding. The Incubator programming provides these younger artists with aesthetic and practical mentorship and support on their way towards self-sustaining productions.",

Through theatre, which invites, even demands, interaction with its audience, our goal is to fire the imagination with love, to celebrate the human capacity to taste and smell, weep and laugh, create and destroy, and wake up where we first fell --- changed, charged and empowered.

Today, Bedlam provides a steady diet of original, avant-garde for Minneapolis and regional audiences. Bedlam Productions vary from 5mins to Full Length and evolve through creative processes that can last 2 weeks to 10 years. As a venue Bedlam supports a year-round calendar of local, national and international artists, in theater, dance, music, puppetry, performance art and more. And as artists, we try new things, so that no year in fourteen has ever been exactly like the last. Bedlam Theatre builds culture and community through and around experimental performing arts \u2013 and their audiences. We support artists that challenge not just form and content but process as well on their adventure to reflect, celebrate and reinvent themselves and their society. We create an atmosphere of dialog with artists and audience. We provide direct engagement through our community programs and partnerships and frequently in our productions.

Founded in 1985 by David Mamet and William H. Macy, Atlantic believes that the story of a play and the intent of its playwright are at the core of the creative process. The plays in the Atlantic repertory, from both new and established playwrights, are boldly interpreted by today's finest theater artists and resonate with contemporary audiences.\nSince its inception, Atlantic has produced more than 100 plays, including the Tony Award winning productions of Spring Awakening and The Beauty Queen of Leenane as well as The Lieutenant of Inishmore by Martin McDonagh, David Mamet\u2019s adaptation of The Voysey Inheritance by Harley Granville Barker, David Mamet\u2019s Romance, Joe Penhall\u2019s Blue/Orange, Dublin Carol by Conor McPherson, Woody Allen\u2019s Writer\u2019s Block, the revival of Hobson\u2019s Choice, the revivals of American Buffalo and Edmond by David Mamet, Dangerous Corner by J.B. Priestley, adapted and directed by David Mamet, The Cider House Rules, adapted by Peter Parnell, Celebration &amp; The Room and The Hothouse, by Harold Pinter, Mojo by Jez Butterworth, the New York premieres of Howard Korder\u2019s Boys\u2019 Life and The Lights at Lincoln Center Theater, Kevin Heelan\u2019s Distant Fires, Quincy Long\u2019s The Joy of Going Somewhere Definite and Shaker Heights, Tom Donaghy\u2019s Minutes From The Blue Route, Edwin Sánchez\u2019 Trafficking in Broken Hearts, and Missing Persons by Craig Lucas.\nProducing great plays is only half of Atlantic's mission. The ATLANTIC ACTING SCHOOL, founded in 1983, operates as both a private conservatory and an undergraduate program in conjunction with New York University. The school focuses on the Practical Aesthetics acting technique, which grew out of a series of NYU summer workshops in Vermont with playwright David Mamet and actor William H. Macy.\nThe ATLANTIC ACTING SCHOOL fosters new generations of theater artists and audiences by creating a student ensemble that allows emerging actors to hone their craft in a safe yet challenging environment. This year the school reached an enrollment of 440 students representing a large cross-section of social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. Distinguished guest lecturers include Sam Shepard, Margo Jefferson, Gore Vidal, Mary Steenburgen, Nicky Silver, Ted Danson and program graduates Kristen Johnston, Camryn Manheim and Eddie Cahill. Atlantic is committed to preparing its students for all aspects of a performing arts career.",

Early on, Amas became a leading voice of multiculturalism in theatre and a pioneering exponent of diversity. Non-traditional casting also became a hallmark of Amas productions. Since joining Amas as Producing Director in 1994 I\u2019ve invested in three core programming areas: 1. The creation of a developmental process for new musicals. 2. Mainstage productions. 3. The growth and development of our youth education programs. A major part of what we do is nurture and help guide talent, creating musicals that will have a significant life beyond their development at Amas. Aside from artistic merit, which is paramount, to be considered for development or production at Amas a work must generally have one of the following characteristics: \u2022 The subject matter must either be about a community or group that has currently, or in its history, struggled under some kind of oppression or minority status that threatens it; or, \u2022 The project must commit to a significant position in multi-ethnic or non-traditional casting. Our intent is to bring people of all colors, ethnicities and backgrounds together through the art of musical theatre.",

We want our collaborators to leave our process with a refreshed sense of purpose and commitment to their craft. We want audiences to leave our productions eager to look at the world through a new lens.\nDuring a performance, the actors and audience inhabit the space together, living through a communal experience infused with life and soul and vigor. Our journeys in life and on stage are seldom easy. Sometimes we have to go through a dark tunnel before we find the light. Renewal does not guarantee a happy ending; it rather offers the possibility of a new beginning. \nOUR VALUES\nOur core values of sustainability, connection, and honesty guide us as we work to live out our mission and look toward realizing our vision. From our business practices to rehearsals to performances, we seek opportunities for sustainable theatrical production - from both our successes and our failures. The connections within and among the company, our collaborators, the artists and audience members, and the community at large are essential to our growth. Running through all we do is our pursuit of honesty. Whether portraying a moment on stage that illuminates our human condition, creating a marketing piece, or resolving conflict within the company, honesty is our touchstone; it is what allows us finally to connect and to grow.\nOUR VISION\nNew Leaf Theatre will reawaken personal connections in order to confront our increasing disengagement and rediscover - together with our audience - a piece of our shared humanity.\nIn order to fulfill our mission of renewal on a larger scale, we must enable ourselves, our collaborators, our friends, our neighbors, our city to connect with one another and the world at large. Our understanding of community has changed dramatically in the last century, but we believe the possibility of true connection still lies within us. The shared experience of performance offers a visceral reminder of what it is to come together, and creates an opportunity to re-enter the world with a renewed sense of our common humanity.",
